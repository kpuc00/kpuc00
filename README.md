## Hello there 👋

#### Who am I? 🤔

My name is Kristiyan Strahilov. Alumnus of Fontys University of Applied Sciences - Eindhoven, Netherlands with interest in Frontend web development. 

#### What am I doing? 🌱
At the beginning of my professional studies, I started developing basic Windows Forms apps using C# which introduced me to the object-oriented programming and gained some knowledge of the .NET framework. Later I have moved on to developing Full-Stack web applications using Java and React.js framework, which gave me a lot of knowledge about the RESTful APIs and Database design. I have also worked on group projects using Agile scrum methodology for development. 
I have specialized "Smart Mobile" where I learned the basics of mobile development by making Kotlin-based Android apps and SwiftUI-based apps for iOS by implementing UX techniques.
