## Hello there 👋

#### Who am I? 🤔

My name is Kristiyan Strahilov. I am a young and inspired international student at Fontys Univerity of Applied Sciences with interest in Full-Stack web development. 

#### What am I doing? 🌱
At the beginning of my professional studies, I started developing basic Windows Forms apps using C#, which introduced me to the object-oriented programming and gained some knowledge of the .NET framework. Later I have moved on to developing Full-Stack web applications using Java and React.js framework, which gave me a lot of knowledge about the RESTful APIs and Database design. I have also worked on group projects with other students in a team using Agile scrum methodology for development.
I also specialize in Smart Mobile where I learned the basics of developing Kotlin-based Android apps and SwiftUI-based apps for iOS by implementing UX techniques.

I am currently looking for an internship. 🔭
